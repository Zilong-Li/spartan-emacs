## Quick Start

`git clone https://github.com/a-schaefers/grokEmacs.git ~/.config/emacs` and if you're new, maybe checkout my [how to grok Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFf4Ibrb-mjTcoaVv6orVtH93K47GPrwl) series.

If you encounter an error in the bootstrap such as: `[2025-08-17 14:11:25] fatal: destination path '/home/$USER/.config/emacs/elpaca/repos/treemacs' already exists and is not an empty directory.` It probably is the result of a partial clone + network timeout, leaving repos/treemacs/ half-baked; the re-clone then balked because the dir existed. In this case the solution is `M-x elpaca-delete RET treemacs` and then restarting Emacs to finish the bootstrap process.

## Announcement

This project does not use GitHub Issues. Instead, please submit your improvements via Pull Request.

grokEmacs is a new rewrite, different from Spartan Emacs, but it achieves many of the same goals in a better way. To find Spartan Emacs, see the [archived branch](https://github.com/a-schaefers/spartan-emacs/tree/spartan-emacs-archive).

## ‚ú® Interactive Initial Setup Wizard üßô

The very first time you launch **grokEmacs**, you‚Äôll be greeted by a short wizard. Your answers are written to `~/.config/emacs/grok-opts.el`

> ‚ö° Tip: If you want to hack things directly, just open `~/.config/emacs/grok-opts.el` after running the wizard. Or you can always restart the wizard with `C-u M-x grok--ensure-opts` if you change your mind about something.

### ü™Ñ What you‚Äôll be asked

The prompts appear one by one in the minibuffer:

1. **üìÇ Projects Directory**
   > ‚ÄúWhere do you keep your code?‚Äù
   Enter the folder path (default: `~/repos`). Projectile & Magit will look here.

2. **üòà Evil Mode or üòá Holy Mode**
   > ‚ÄúDo you want Vim-style keys?‚Äù
   Choose Evil if you live in Vim-land, or stick with Emacs defaults.

3. **üßô Theme Setup**
   > ‚ÄúDo you want to customize the look, or keep it vanilla?‚Äù
   - **Skip** ‚Üí You get pure ‚Äúangry fruit salad‚Äù Emacs defaults.
   - **Continue** ‚Üí Pick *fancy* or *minimal* styling.

4. **üé® Fancy vs Minimal**
   - **Fancy** ‚Üí Install a theme package (default: `doom-themes`), pick a theme (default: `doom-one`), and choose a modeline style (`doom`, `spaceline`, `moody`, or none).
   - **Minimal** ‚Üí Stick to built-in themes like `modus-operandi` or `modus-vivendi`. A clean modeline shows just the essentials (modified, file, line, mode).

5. **ü™ü Transparency**
   > ‚ÄúWant to see through your editor?‚Äù
   Type a number `0‚Äì99` (lower = more see-through). Leave blank or `100` for solid.

6. **üî§ Font & üìè Size**
   > ‚ÄúWhat font do you like? And how big should it be?‚Äù
   Defaults to *Source Code Pro* and *11* if you‚Äôre not picky.
   It will fallback to Monospace if the font is not found on your system.

7. **üî¢ Line Numbers**
   > ‚ÄúDo you want line numbers?‚Äù
   If yes, you‚Äôll also be asked whether you prefer absolute or relative.

### üé© Fancy Mode

With Fancy enabled, grokEmacs pulls in your chosen theme package, applies your selected theme, and wires up extras:
- Dashboard on startup
- Treemacs sidebar
- Custom modeline (Doom/Spaceline/Moody)
- Window auto-resizing + splash (disable with `(setq grok-window-pop-enabled nil)` and `(setq grok-window-pop-splash t)`)

doom-themes, doom-one, doom-modeline, splash:

```elisp
(setq grok-projects "~/repos/")
(setq grok-evil-mode nil)
(setq grok-theme t)
(setq grok-theme-style "fancy")
(setq grok-custom-theme-pkg 'doom-themes)
(setq grok-custom-theme 'doom-one)
(setq grok-use-modeline "doom")
(setq grok-alpha-background "100")
(setq grok-font "Go Mono")
(setq grok-font-size "11")
(setq grok-line-numbers t)
(setq grok-relative-line-numbers nil)
(setq grok-core-disabled '())
(setq grok-packages-disabled '())
(setq grok-window-pop-enabled t)
(setq grok-window-pop-splash t)
```

spacemacs-theme, spacemacs-dark, spaceline `grok-opts.el`:

```elisp
(setq grok-projects "~/repos/")
(setq grok-evil-mode nil)
(setq grok-theme t)
(setq grok-theme-style "fancy")
(setq grok-custom-theme-pkg 'spacemacs-theme)
(setq grok-custom-theme 'spacemacs-dark)
(setq grok-use-modeline "spaceline")
(setq grok-alpha-background "97")
(setq grok-font "Go Mono")
(setq grok-font-size "11")
(setq grok-line-numbers t)
(setq grok-relative-line-numbers nil)
(setq grok-core-disabled '())
(setq grok-packages-disabled '())
(setq grok-window-pop-enabled t)
(setq grok-window-pop-splash t)
```

![fancy](screen2.jpg)

tao-theme, tao-yang, moody `grok-opts.el`, no-splash:

```elisp
(setq grok-projects "~/repos/")
(setq grok-evil-mode nil)
(setq grok-theme t)
(setq grok-theme-style "fancy")
(setq grok-custom-theme-pkg 'tao-theme)
(setq grok-custom-theme 'tao-yang)
(setq grok-use-modeline "moody")
(setq grok-alpha-background "100")
(setq grok-font "Go Mono")
(setq grok-font-size "11")
(setq grok-line-numbers t)
(setq grok-relative-line-numbers nil)
(setq grok-core-disabled '())
(setq grok-packages-disabled '())
(setq grok-window-pop-enabled t)
(setq grok-window-pop-splash nil)
```

#### Disable some module file from loading

So you looked at init.el and grok-core, and decided you don't want grok-better-defaults and grok-better-scratch to load at all? Just append in grok-opts.el,

```elisp
(setq grok-core-disabled '(grok-better-defaults grok-better-scratch))
```

#### Disable some specific packages from loading

So you looked at grok-core/grok-evil.el and you like most of it, but you would rather leave which-key and general.el configuration to yourself,

```elisp
(setq grok-packages-disabled '(which-key general))
```

Then you might for example create new files in grok.d, or just add the configuration you want to grok.d/grok.el.

### üì¶ Minimal Mode

Minimal mode skips the extra fancy bloat and gives you just enough polish. You‚Äôll pick one of the built-in themes (recommended: `modus-operandi` or `modus-vivendi`), and get a lightweight modeline. If you want the vanilla modeline, though, just set `(setq grok-use-modeline "none")`.

## Keybinds

### Holy Mode (Emacs style)

In **Holy mode** you keep Emacs‚Äô world-class defaults, plus a few helpers and a leader system:

- **Emacs defaults** - all the standard `C-x ...` / `M-x ...` bindings.
- **M-m leader** - powered by `which-key` + `general.el`. Press **M-m** to explore menus.
- **Language extras** - when editing code, **M-m** includes `eglot` bindings.
- **crux** - smarter line movement, duplicate lines, kill whole line, etc.
- **paredit** - structural Lisp editing, keeps parentheses balanced.

### Evil Mode (Vim style)

If you enabled Evil during setup, you get Vim‚Äôs modal editing plus a leader system:

- **Evil defaults** - normal/insert/visual modes and Vim-style motions.
- **SPACE leader** - powered by `which-key` + `general.el`. Press **Space** to explore menus.
- **Language extras** - when editing code, **M-m** is available for `eglot` bindings.
- **evil-collection** - makes Magit, Dired, and other modes feel natural in Vim.
- **evil-commentary** - toggle comments with `gc`.
- **evil-surround** - add/change/delete surrounding quotes, parens, tags.
- **evil-matchit** - jump between matching pairs (if/else, HTML tags, etc.).
- **evil-cleverparens** - Lisp structural editing, Vim-style (like paredit).

### Treesit to the future

As treesit support improves, we probably will target [combobulate](https://github.com/mickeynp/combobulate) to get a sort-of of paredit-like
experience beyond scheme/lisp language families.

### Additional language-specific binds

Language modes may add their own bindings as needed.

## Assumptions

### emacs versions

- Expects Emacs 30+ --with-native-compilation --with-tree-sitter ...

### terminal

I do not care about Terminal Emacs. If a hardcore `emacs -nw` user wants to improve that experience, I will gladly merge a PR, provided it meets these conditions:

- All GUI-only assumptions must be guarded with (display-graphic-p) checks, and likewise for terminal-only code.
- Clipboard handling must work out of the box, as graphical Emacs already provides, with compatibility across Xorg, Wayland, and macOS.
- Themes must not look terrible in terminal mode - either by disabling global font-lock, or by using a minimal terminal-only theme that lets the terminal handle colors.
