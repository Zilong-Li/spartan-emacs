Noticed quite a few cloners the last couple days in the repo insights.
Sorry about all the breakage while putting this together.
I'm just about stable and development will chill again, soon.
Thanks for understanding o/

# grokEmacs

[how to grok Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFf4Ibrb-mjTcoaVv6orVtH93K47GPrwl)

fork it - clone it - own it.

`git clone https://github.com/a-schaefers/grokEmacs.git ~/.config/emacs`

If you encounter an error in the bootstrap such as: `[2025-08-17 14:11:25] fatal: destination path '/home/$USER/.config/emacs/elpaca/repos/treemacs' already exists and is not an empty directory.` It probably is the result of a partial clone + network timeout, leaving repos/treemacs/ half-baked; the re-clone then balked because the dir existed. In this case the solution is `M-x elpaca-delete RET treemacs` and then restarting Emacs to finish the bootstrap process.

## Announcement

This project does not use GitHub Issues. Instead, please submit your improvements via Pull Request.

grokEmacs is a new rewrite, different from Spartan Emacs, but it achieves many of the same goals in a better way. To find Spartan Emacs, see the [archived branch](https://github.com/a-schaefers/spartan-emacs/tree/spartan-emacs-archive).

## Interactive Initial Setup

On first launch, grokEmacs asks a few setup questions (projects dir, Evil mode, theme style, font, font size, line numbers, transparency, etc.) and saves your answers to ~/.config/emacs/grok-opts.el. You can rerun the wizard anytime with C-u M-x grok--ensure-opts, or edit the file directly since it‚Äôs just a series of setqs. You can also skip the pre-baked theming entirely and stick with pure angry-fruit. In Fancy mode, grokEmacs also resizes the window and pops Treemacs on startup; if you don‚Äôt like that, disable it with (setq grok-window-pop-enabled nil) üçª.

Fancy loads a user-chosen theme package and theme name, defaulting to doom-themes with doom-one if unsure. It also enables Doom or Spacemacs modeline, Treemacs, Dashboard, and related extras.

Minimal lets the user pick a built-in theme, recommending modus-vivendi or modus-operandi, with a clean, uncluttered modeline.

## Project goals

- **elpaca** package manager + **use-package**
- **gccemacs** native compilation
- **eglot lsp + company** autocompletion
- **magit+projectile** for VC & project awareness
- **flymake** linting (sideline, eldoc-box)
- **treesitter** everywhere as much as possible
- **vertico** fuzzy completion
- *[dape](https://github.com/svaante/dape) (debug adapter protocol support) is planned, coming soon*

## Binds

The project aims to keep opinionated (or commonly customized) binds limited to grok.el for easy customization. M-x `grok-show-binds` will show what those are.

Binds are basically defaults, you get Emacs‚Äô vanilla keybindings, which is already first-class, plus a couple helpers:

- **crux** ‚Äî quality-of-life shortcuts (smarter line movement, duplicate, kill whole line, etc.).
- **paredit** ‚Äî structural editing for Lisp code, keeps parens balanced.

If you enabled Evil during setup, you get Vim binds plus common addons:

- **evil** ‚Äî core Vim emulation.
- **evil-collection** ‚Äî makes Magit, dired, and many other modes feel Vim-like.
- **evil-commentary** ‚Äî toggle comments with `gc`, like Vim‚Äôs commentary.
- **evil-surround** ‚Äî change/add/delete surrounding quotes, parens, tags.
- **evil-matchit** ‚Äî jump between matching pairs (if/else, HTML tags, etc.).
- **evil-cleverparens** ‚Äî Lisp structural editing, Vim-style (similar to paredit).

This is still a work in progress.

### Treesit to the future

As treesit support improves, we probably will target [combobulate](https://github.com/mickeynp/combobulate) to get a sort-of of paredit-like
experience beyond scheme/lisp language families.

### Additional language-specific binds

Language modes may add their own bindings as needed.
## Assumptions

### emacs versions

- Expects Emacs 30+ --with-native-compilation --with-tree-sitter ...

### terminal

I do not care about Terminal Emacs. If a hardcore `emacs -nw` user wants to improve that experience, I will gladly merge a PR, provided it meets these conditions:

- All GUI-only assumptions must be guarded with (display-graphic-p) checks, and likewise for terminal-only code.
- Clipboard handling must work out of the box, as graphical Emacs already provides, with compatibility across Xorg, Wayland, and macOS.
- Themes must not look terrible in terminal mode - either by disabling global font-lock, or by using a minimal terminal-only theme that lets the terminal handle colors.
